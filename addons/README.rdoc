== JS-compat::Addons

JS-Compat::Addons is a collection of obstrusive methods that provides a few
useful methods to standard prototypes, like Element.hasClassName(),
Element.setStyle() or String.trim().

It also implements some unobstrusive objects, like Ajax.

== TODO

* Ajax should transparently support sending and receiving XML, JSON, etc.
