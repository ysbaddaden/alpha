TODO:

  * Find a better CSS3 selector engine (faster and full featured). The one I wrote
    is just a joke (it's too slow and limited).

  * I'm not that satisfied with the Ajax object. It's mostly an interface to XHR.
    Maybe if it transparently supports XML and JSON I'll like it better :)


IE bugs :

  * elm.parentNode is defined whatever if the element is inserted in the DOM or not.
    You can't use it to check if the element is inserted or not.
  
    Quick fix: check for 'elm.parentNode' and 'elm.parentNode.tagName'.


IE 8 bugs :

  * In order to be sure to use IE8's engine (and not a compatibility view or whatever)
    you have to declare the X-UA-Compatible HTTP meta. Otherwise, expect problems.
    
    I personally use: <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge"/>

  * You musn't declare a 'var Element' or 'var Event' or whatever DOM prototype in a
    script, even inside an if block like the following example, because the variable
    will be set to 'undefined' for the whole script, causing the if check to be true!
  
    if (typeof Element == 'undefined') {
      var Element = function() {};
    }

  * IE8 implements elm.querySelectorAll(), which comes with restricted support of CSS
    selectors (CSS2.1 only, and no CSS3 at all).
