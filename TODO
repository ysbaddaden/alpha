TODO:

  * A Drag And Drop library.
  * UI.Sortable as an example of DND.
  
  * Implement custom events (as defined by the DOM).
    See http://deanedwards.me.uk/weblog/2009/03/callbacks-vs-events/ for a 
    solution.
  
  * A transparent SVG rendered/manipulator which uses VML.

COULD DO:

  * A charting library to draw charts --something that uses SVG.
