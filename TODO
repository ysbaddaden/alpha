TODO:

  * I'm not that satisfied with the Ajax object. It's just an interface to
    XMLHttpRequest. Maybe if it transparently supported XML and JSON I'd like it
    better :)
  
  * A translation library. I'm not sure how to handle this: a per language
    JSON file; have multiple compiled files per language?
  
  * A Drag And Drop library (is it possible to follow the standards, thus have
    it in Compat?). Implement UI.Sortable as an example.
  
  * An animation library (Fx) to enable some DHTML.


COULD DO:

  * A charting library to draw charts --something that uses SVG and Canvas.
  * A game library, with sprite animations, collisions, etc.
